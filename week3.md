# Week 2

## The MERN Stack

MERN is an acronym for a commonly used stack of technologies for building web
applications:

- MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com): a document store for the database
- Express (https://expressjs.com): a minimal web server framework for Node.js
- React (https://reactjs.org): a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Node (https://nodejs.org): a command line-based JavaScript runtime built
  on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Note, I recommend checking out some courses on sites such as Udemy, which can
provide a thorough overview and exploration of these technologies. Here are a
few you might consider checking out:

- https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/ Covers
  the development of Node.js applications with Mongo DB and express. The
  instructors are the authors of some of the most subscribed to courses on the
  site.
- https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nodejs-express-mongodb-the-mern-fullstack-guide/
  is a full course on developing MERN stack applications. When I was learning
  JavaScript and web development, I did several courses by Maximilian
  Schwarzm√ºller - he is one of my favourite instructors on the site.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is a document-based storage engine that is designed to work seamlessly
with JavaScript. Instead of data being stored in tables, like in a relational
database, it is organized into a set of collections of documents, which are
similar to JavaScript Objects.

For example, a MongoDB database may have a collection called "users", which
holds many documents that describe the users of a system. Each document in the
"users" collection would describe one user, and may look something like this:

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId(<Mongo-Generated 24 character hexadecimal string>),
  email: "joe@test.com",
  firstName: "Joe",
  lastName: "Test",
}
```

### Node.js

Node JS is the JavaScript runtime we will use to run the backend of the
application.  You can download the LTS version of the runtime from
https://nodejs.org

The NodeJS runtime comes with several programs, the most important of which are:

- `node`: starts the node runtime.
- `npm`: the Node Package Manager. This is used to download and install
  third-party libraries and packages which we can use to write Node
  applications.

To create a new Node.js project, first install Node.  Now, from a command line
prompt, in the folder you want to use as the project root (usually the root
folder of a git repository), run

```bash
$ npm init
```

And answer the questions the CLI prompts you with. After doing this, you should
see a file called `package.json` in your folder. This file contains the
information which describes your Node.js package (such as name, author, git
repo, dependencies, entry point file, and so on).

Here is an example `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "My Application",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is an example Node package",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node main.js"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/jhbertra/samle-project.git"
  },
  "author": "Jamie Bertram",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/jhbertra/samle-project/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/jhbertra/samle-project#readme",
  "dependencies": {
  }
}
```

`scripts` are a set of commands you can execute to run certain tasks in your
project. To run a script, you run

```bash
$ npm run <script-name>
```

`start` and `test` are special script names which can be run with the commands:

```bash
$ npm start
$ npm test
```

In other words, you can drop the `run` part. Running `npm start` will run the
command `node main.js`, which will start a new Node process, and execute the
`main.js` file.

### Node Modules and NPM

NPM is both the name of the registry for publishing and downloading JavaScript
packages (https://www.npmjs.com/), and the command line tool for managing `NPM`
packages.

What we mostly care about for this project is the ability to download and
install third-party packages which we will use to write our application.

For example, if we want to communicate with a Mongo database, there is an NPM
package which exposes the functionality we need to do this called `mongodb`. To
install this package, we run

```bash
$ npm install mongodb
```
This does 2 things:

1. It downloads the package, along with any of its dependencies, and saves
   them in a folder called `node_modules`.
2. It writes an entry to the `dependencies` object in `package.json`, which
   describes the name of the package we installed, and the version we depend on.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "mongodb": "^3.5.4"
}
```

Now, from any file in our application,
we can write

```js
const mongo = requrie("mongodb");
```

And have access to the functions exported by the `mongodb` module.

### Express

Express is a framework for creating web servers. The way you use Express is by
creating an application object with the `express()` function, and registering
handler functions for client requests.

Here is a very simple example of an Express application:

```js
const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.get("/hello", function (req, res) {
  res.send("hi there");
});

app.listen(8080);
```

We first import the `express` NPM package:

```js
const express = require("express");
```

Then we create a new express app:

```js
const app = express();
````

We register a callback which will handle HTTP GET requests to the `/hello`
endpoint:

```js
app.get("/hello", function (req, res) {
  res.send("hi there\n");
});
```

Finally, we listen for incoming connections on port 8080.

```js
app.listen(8080);
```

To run this simple application, we save this as a javascript file (e.g.
`server.js`), and run it with `node`:

```bash
$ node server.js
```

We can now send HTTP requests to our application, and it will handle them:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello
hi there
```

### React

I'll spare going over React, since you are already familiar with it.

## Task 1 - Install Necessary Software

You will need to install, at a minimum:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- Mongo DB (https://www.mongodb.com)

## Task 2 - Setup the backend

Checkout `master`, pull latest changes, and create a new branch to work on:

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git checkout -b task/setup-node
```

Now, initialize a new npm project in the repo root:

```bash
npm init
```

You will be prompted to fill out some information - for the most part you can go
with the defaults. You can name the project whatever you like.

Commit the `package.json` file to the repo:

```bash
$ git add package.json
$ git commit -m "initialze node package"
```

Now, install a few packages which we will need:

```bash
$ npm install express mongodb
```

You will notice two new things:

1. A `node_modules` folder will be created. We want to add this to the
   `.gitignore`, and not commit this directory to the repo.

   ```bash
   echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
   ```
2. A `package-lock.json` file. We _do_ want to check this file into the repo, as
   it will ensure that the versions of all the installed packagtes do not change
   between installs on different machines unless we explicitly want them to.

Commit the changes:

```bash
$ echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
$ git add package*.json .gitignore
$ git commit "install mongodb and express packages"
```

Create a file called `server.js` which creates and runs a new express web app.

```js
const express = require("express");

# Entry point for our application
async function main() {
  const app = express();

  return app.listen(8080);
}

// Run the main function.
main();
```

Add and commit this file.

With all this done, push the branch to GitHub

```bash
$ git push -u origin task/setup-node
```

And create a Pull Request.

## Task 3 - Setup the database

After merging the previous task, create another new branch

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git branch -d task/setup-node     # Delete the previous branch
$ git checkout -b task/setup-mongo
```

Create a new file called `db.js`. Here, we will initialize our database
connection and set schema validation rules for our collections.

```js
const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");

module.exports = async function () {
  # URL to our local Mongo instance - we will worry about configuring this
  # later.
  const url = "mongodb://localhost:27017";

  # The name of the database we will create in Mongo
  const dbName = "messenger";

  # Connect to the server
  const client = await MongoClient.connect(url);

  # Open a connection to the database
  const db = client.db(dbName);

  # initialize our collections
  db.createCollection("users", {
    validator: {
      // Left as an exercise - see note below
    },
  });

  db.createCollection("rooms", {
    validator: {
      // Left as an exercise - see note below
    },
  });

  db.createCollection("messages", {
    validator: {
      // Left as an exercise - see note below
    },
  });

  return { client, db };
}
```

NOTE - Mongo db allows you to specify schema validation rules using a standard
called JSON schema. Here is a page that describes this in detail:
(https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/). With schema
validation, MongoDB will throw an error if we attempt to write data which does
not satify the schema. Try and use JSON schema and the documentation provided in
the link above to implement the schema specifications in `schema.md`.

Commit this file.

Update `server.js` to call this function and make the database connection
available to the rest of the application. We also want to ensure that when
the server is shut down, we close the connection to Mongo, so it is free to use
the resources it has allocated for the connection:

```js
const express = require("express");
const makeDb = require("./db");

# Entry point for our application
async function main() {
  const app = express();

  # Create a connection to the database which we can pass down where it is required.
  const { client, db } = await makeDb();

  return { server: app.listen(8080), client };
}

// Run the main function.
main().then(({ server, client }) => {
  # Run the shutdown function when we receive a kill signal
  process.on("SIGTERM", shutDown);
  process.on("SIGINT", shutDown);

  function shutDown () {
    console.log("Received kill signal, shutting down gracefully");

    // close the server
    server.close();

    // close connection to Mongo
    client.close();

    // exit gracefully
    process.exit(0);
  }
});
```

NOTE - it is good practice to gracefully close open connections to database
engines, as it tells them they may free up resources associated with the
connection. The only way we have to close our application is by sending it a
kill signal (e.g. by pressing `ctrl-c` in the terminal running the server),
which we can handle with a function.

Commit your changes to `server.js` and make a Pull Request.
